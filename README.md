## STAR Method Description

### Situation

The mobile app market is highly competitive, with thousands of applications competing for visibility and downloads. Businesses need clear insights into app performance metrics such as installs, ratings, pricing strategy, and category trends to make informed growth decisions.

Raw datasets alone do not provide clarity. Decision-makers require structured dashboards that summarize performance and highlight opportunities.

* Design an interactive dashboard in Google Looker Studio
* Analyze app performance data
* Identify patterns between installs and ratings
* Evaluate category-wise performance
* Provide business insights to support app growth strategies

The dashboard needed to be clean, professional, and decision-focused.

### Action

To complete this project, the following steps were taken:

1. Data Preparation

   * Cleaned inconsistent install values and converted them into numeric format
   * Standardized rating and price fields
   * Created calculated fields for install segments and performance grouping

2. Data Modeling in Looker Studio

   * Connected structured dataset to Google Looker Studio
   * Built calculated metrics such as average rating, total installs, and category-wise aggregation
   * Created install-based performance segments (e.g., 10K–100K, 100K–1M, 1M+)

3. Dashboard Development

   * Designed KPI scorecards for key metrics
   * Developed category comparison charts
   * Built rating vs installs analysis visuals
   * Added filters for category, price type (free/paid), and install range
   * Ensured interactive filtering for business users

4. Insight Generation

   * Identified high-performing categories
   * Evaluated relationship between installs and ratings
   * Analyzed free vs paid app distribution
   * Highlighted potential strategic focus areas
